1# How to hunt for job leads

Arguably this phase may break your soul. 

But closing any deal - not just an extended offer, may still become a heartbreak. 

So, let's see what we can do to make it suck less once we're through with the [preparation](prepare).

## What makes up the hunt phase?

Well, it's pretty self-evident, but I'll spell it out. Essentially, you're doing your best to have enough interesting job leads to research, consider and apply to. On the apply part I have my reservation about the best way being through entering into the ATS via the machine's way, but more about it later.

Let's dive into the parts.

This is just as important as the way you'd sell, market or distribute a product (or service.) Hence the total separation into five main type of channels--[job boards](job-boards), [networking](networking), [direct](direct-approach), [recruiting agencies](recruiting-agencies) and [personal branding](personal-branding)--discussed separately.
