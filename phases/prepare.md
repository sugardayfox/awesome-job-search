# Prepare for your job search the right way

I could have called this as the Research phase too. Both are telling. 

You need to prepare which involves bunch of research. 

Here are the tools and tips to help you:

## What makes up the preparation

Note: I put in a star (âœ¨) for every tool that I have used and prefer for any reason.

### 1. Identify your career values

It doesn't really makes sense going for jobs that doesn't align or straight goes against your career values, based on your personal values. 
  
First, use what you already have. 

_Reflect on your past_

Think about the jobs and experiences that you have had in the past and consider what you liked and disliked about them. What values were most important to you in those roles?

_General tools and tips to find out about your Personal values_

* [Personalvalu.es](https://personalvalu.es/) - [FREE] tool
* [Values Questionnaire from PositivePsychology.com](https://positivepsychology.com/values-questionnaire/) - a downloadable questionnaire if that's your thing, still [FREE]
* [Personal Values Assesment tool](https://www.valuescentre.com/tools-assessments/pva/) - used to be free now USD 19.95, and I got nothing to gain if you buy it.

_Specific tools and tips for assessing your Career values_

A fair warning, some of these may not be up your alley and were deemed not useful in candidate assessment, so maybe not include it straight on all your profiles.
Also, most will have upgrade option. If you find out any would get paygated, put in an issue or more friendly [contribute](./).

Now, once you're done with figuring yourself out.
It's time to cast your eyes to the wild jungle of jobs out there.

### 2. Research potential employers and jobs

Here the main tip is to find out which spaces and what type of companies has look up skills in job ads and also to see where you can find jobs the easiest. 
Also, here's the place to figure out what jobs pay and do they even have remote/hybrid jobs advertised?

You can start the easy way searching on [job boards](/channels/job-boards.md).

Tips and resources helping you research companies within spaces or industries of your chosing is discussed in detail in the [direct approach](/channels/direct-approach.md). 

So, let's see what resources you have to cover the last important step in the research step. 

_Salary research_

* âœ¨[Averagesalarysurvey.com](https://www.averagesalarysurvey.com/)--quite useful if you live or move to Europe.
* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com)--tries to help with salaries too, depends on the geography you look for a job in though.

* âœ¨[Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/)--especially useful for folks in Tech.

### 3. Get your resume in order

Now this is one of the hardest to do as they say. 
My 2 cents is that you:

a) take it easy on yourself,
b) if you have the skills and experience, make sure you present them in the best and easiest to read format
c) if you don't have the skills or experience, go learning and do projects that helps to fill the void, now.

If anything you may want to use a resume builder, especially if you have nothing or you want to totally redo your resume.

_Resume builders_

I'd leave alone the resume templates and concentrate on builders if you've not a polished CV already.

* [Resumemonk](https://www.resumonk.com/)--on the premium you can build multiple versions.
* âœ¨[StandardResume](https://standardresume.co/)--well loved in the tech space.
* âœ¨[VisualCV](https://www.visualcv.com/)--has some interesting resources too like International CV guides. 
* 

_Resume graders_

May give you useful pointers. 



_Grammar checkers_

Yep, they help to not stand out with poor English. 

* âœ¨[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com)--even the free version may be helpful if you have issues. 
* âœ¨[HemingwayApp](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)--quite good at helping you sound more simple and avoid sentences with more than 24 words.
* âœ¨[ProWritingAid]()--is the one I use for anything complex or important enough, including reviewing my cv. 

_AI Writers_

Well, the judgement is still not in if it would be a no-no. So, let's have a few here that can do the job alright. Just make sure you add on your own way to say things else there may be too much friction when you hit the interviews stages.

### 4. Do have a Cover letter, just in case

Yet another controversial topic. 
Some will insist you absolute have to include one to stand out. 
My take is that if they insist in a job ad and you cannot approach the hiring manager straight, you need one that is easy to personalize/tailor to the job requirements and company. 

If you go direct then you'll need to write something in your cold or semi-warm outreach email anyway, so better be ready with something.
