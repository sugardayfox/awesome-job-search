# Awesome Job Search

Yes, I know this headline feels counterintuitive. But the list of resources, hopefully, will be an awesome help even if it feels your job search mostly sucks.

## Why bother

So, why did I put together this. 

0. Back in 2019 I spent a couple months doing customer discovery for a job search app project. And I've yet to find a great way to open source the findings and find contributors to bring the resources to the masses for maximum impact. Here are two LinkedIn posts as the pinnacle of what I shared. 
1. There's no list to help engineers, or regular folks who venture here, get some help with job search here on Github. While there are tons of great, ahem, [Awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). 
2. 
3. Why here? GitHub is one of the easiest places to collaborate for me. 

> Aside: if you learn the basics of Git and how to get around on Github, you already scored, so here are two 101s on the two:
> 1. [Hubspot's Tutorial](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)
> 2. [Begginer's Guide from FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/)

3. Why now? There's no other list, there's one for Engineers, yet as of 22 Jan 2023, it's totally empty. The [list here on Github that comes closest is](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#work) which gives you pointers to interesting work related awesome lists on GitHub.

## How to find stuff in here

There are three ways to chunk up the resources, by:

* **Phases of Job search**--[Prepare](phases/prepare.md), [Hunt](phases/hunt.md) and [Close](phases/close.md)
* **Channels of Job search**--[Networking](channels/networking.md), [Personal branding](channels/personal-branding.md), [Direct approach](channels/direct-approach.md), [Job boards](channels/job-boards.md) and [Recruiting agencies](channels/recruiting-agencies.md)
* **Industries**--[Talent acquisition folks](industries/talent-acquisition.md), [Tech](industries/tech.md)

In the tooling section I may include ðŸ’¶ AFFILIATE ðŸ’¶ links. That will be clearly marked, and if you purchase within a time frame, typically between 45 and 90 days, I may get a bit of commission.

If you have time and want to put in some effort to help others coming behind you.

## How to contribute

I'll probably add more. 

But generally:
0. submit an issue if you have found issues (typo or factual)
1. you will need a GithuB account
2. you will need to fork this repo(sitory)
3. you will need to make a new branch, N.B. [can do it here on GitHub too](https://www.howtogeek.com/714112/how-to-create-a-new-branch-in-github/)
4. make the changes, can do it on GitHub too,
5. [make a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

## Credits

I have first found out about Awesome lists from [Ripenaar's Free For Dev list](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev). 
All other credit will be added here or simply as citation in the specific files. 
Less of a credit and more of a how this whole thing started for me - a [LinkedIn article of mine about the job search framework](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introducing-job-search-matrix-dez-papp/) I devised.
