# How to negotiate and close a job offer

Closing a deal or a job offer is more of an art and a bunch of trial and error. 

Of course if you build on a solid base - you [prepared](preparation) yourself thouroughly and you kept yourself motivated through the [hunt](hunt). Your chances are already better.

Note: I put in some twinkles (âœ¨) for every tool that I have used and prefer for any reason.

The main thing you have to nail are:

## Interview Preparation and (Offer) Negotiation resources

I lumped them together as they are intertwined, especially if you'd happen to go via a third party route (think of agency recruiters). 
Some of these resources are better than the rest, but I've haven't tested any of them:

### 1. Interview preparation

Here are some tools to get you going:

* [BigInterview](biginterview.com)--In their own words: "Proven, step-by-step job interview preparation system to land your dream job and salary, regardless of your experience."
* [Levels.fyi Services](https://www.levels.fyi/services/)--they offer Negotiation, Resume review and Interview prep geared towards techie folks.
* [MyInterviewPractice](myinterviewpractice.com)--In their own words: "my interview practice offers an easy to use web tool to practice full length interviews. sign up for free and launch our interview simulator to start practicing today!"
* âœ¨ [Trovinto](https://trovinto.com/)--a friend of mine builds this AI assisted tool for busy hiring managers and junior recruiters. Still free and may be helpful for you to get a good set of interview questions that should be typical for the role. Bonus: you'll have answers too. Now, I do not advocate you base all your approach on tactic. 
* [Vueprep](https://vueprep.com/)--In their own words: "Preparing for your online interviews? VuePrep makes it easy to practice with hundreds of real interview questions, simulate a realistic online interview setting and get instant reviews on your interview performance."

Some sound advice:
