# How to hunt for job leads

Arguably this phase may break your soul. 

But closing any deal - not just an extended offer, may still become a heartbreak. 

So, let's see what we can do to make it suck less once we're through with the [preparation](prepare).

## What makes up the hunt phase?

Well, it's pretty self-evident, but I'll spell it out. Essentially, you're doing your best to have enough interesting job leads to research, consider and apply to. On the apply part I have my reservation about the best way being through entering into the ATS via the machine's way, but more about it later.

Let's dive into the parts.

### 1. Finding job leads

This is just as important as the way you'd sell, market or distribute a product (or service.) Hence the total separation into five main type of channels--[job boards](job-boards), [networking](networking), [direct](direct-approach), [recruiting agencies](recruiting-agencies) and [personal branding](personal-branding)--discussed separately.

Pick any of the channels I mention above as a starting point. 

### 2. Keeping track of job leads and application - a job CRM

This should include all channels and lead generation efforts, but at the least provide you with. 
Some of the tools:

#### _ Built to purpose_ 

* [Huntr](https://huntr.co/)--In their words: "Job application tracker & crm. huntr keeps track of every detail about your job applications - notes, dates, tasks, job descriptions, salaries, locations, company data and more."
* [JobHero](https://gojobhero.com/)--In their words: "JobHero is a smart dashboard for your entire job search."
* [Joustlist](https://joustlist.com/)--has a free and paying tier, which will help keep it around for your next job search.
* [ValuesFit](https://valuesfit.com/)--Comes with a handy Chrome Extension.

#### _Complex job search platforms and apps_

* âœ¨ [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/jobs)--you can [network](networking), [reach out directly](direct-approach), research, enhance your [personal brand](personal-branding), find jobs
* âœ¨ [MeetFrank](https://meetfrank.com/)--A mobile app for job search and hanging out with a community of folks looking for startup jobs. Mostly in Europe, specifically in the Baltics. 
* âœ¨ [Torre](https://torre.co)--made in Colombia, a social platform a bit like LinkedIn chiefly used and geared towards Latin America. To find jobs and network.

#### _General project management tools with jobsearch CRM templates_

You may have worked with any of these three tools. All are great, and all has Templates for helping you with a job search. 

* âœ¨ [Coda](https://coda.grsm.io/dez)--ðŸ’¶ AFFILIATE ðŸ’¶--free to sign up with limitations, you'll have USD 10 in credit towards future upgrade if signing up via this link. Once you signed up you can follow this link to find [27 Job search related templates](https://coda.io/gallery/search?q=JOb%20search) to kick start your hunt. 
* âœ¨ [Notion](https://notion.so)--my present favorite for life OS (life operation system). I still like it especially because of the versatility and being the most no-code. To find a central or official template wasn't fruitful. So here's a [batch of free job search tracker templates for Notion](https://bridgeurl.com/notion-job-search-tracker-crm-templates), hope you'll like at least on of them. 
* âœ¨ [Trello](https://trelllo.com)--Disclaimer: I was an avid Trello user through most of the 2010s. If you are new to Trello start with this [Blog post that walks you through most of the features](https://blog.trello.com/job-hunt-trello-template) (some you'll find useful, some you may not want to pay for yet.) If you're a pro Trello nerd, [go directly to the Job Hunt Template](https://trello.com/templates/operations-hr/job-hunt-d3yVjzRE).
